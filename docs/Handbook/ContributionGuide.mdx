## Adding New Pages and Sections

The handbook uses Docusaurus's documentation functionality as the foundation for its folder and content structure. You can learn more about Docusaurus at [Docusaurus Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

- Every folder must contain an `index.mdx` file. This file will be rendered as the homepage for that section of the handbook.
- Refer to this template for the index page: [Index Template](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/handbook/blob/main/templates/index-template-folder.mdx).
- Although Docusaurus supports both `.md` and `.mdx` file extensions, we recommend using `.mdx` to maintain uniformity across the project.
- Maintainer tags should be present on every page. See all available team members here: [Team JSON](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/oet-data-bank/blob/master/team.json). We use email as a unique identifier.
- All pages must include the following metadata:
```
sidebar_position: 3.7
sidebar_label: "Contribution Guide"
```
- The sidebar position is determined by the parent folder's index page. It should be a single digit for index pages and two digits for other pages in the same directory.
- `sidebar_label` is the name that will appear in the sidebar and other navigation elements. It is best practice to keep it the same as the main heading on the page.
- For best practices, folders should be named using camelCase. For example, the folder for this page should be named `ContributionGuide.mdx`.
- Documents that fall under the controlled category should have the Controlled Document Banner present.
- For implementing navigation, refer to [Docusaurus Navigation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/links).
- Here is also a link to the template for non-index pages: [Page Template](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/handbook/blob/main/templates/page-template.mdx).
