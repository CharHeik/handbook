# Handbook Usage

## Handbook first approach

The Open Energy Transition handbook is where the company information and processes are made easily accessible.

It is also a tool used to facilitate process modifications, by means of an _handbook first_ approach.

In fact, instead of proposing changes via an email, chat message or any another medium, we follow what described below:
- A (process) problem comes up, frequently in an issue or chat.
- A proposal is made in a pull request to the handbook.
- The proposal is reviewed and discussed in the company. If approved, it becomes part of handbook

We recognize that this approach might be slower at first, but we believe that it saves time in the long run and avoids misunderstandings. This is because it allows the audience to understand better the context in which the change is proposed and what the implications for other potentially affected processes might be.
