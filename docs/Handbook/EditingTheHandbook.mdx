## General information on how to edit the handbook

There are two possibilities to modify the Open Energy Transition (OET) Handbook.

### Editing the handbook locally

The [README](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/handbook/blob/main/README.md) details how to install and fetch locally the necessary dependencies, generate the JSON for the handbook structure and run a local development server.

#### Open Energy Transition (internal) contributors
If you belong to the Open Energy Transition team, you can contribute by following these steps:
- Clone the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Make your changes and commit them.
- Push your changes to your branch.
- Open a pull request.

#### External contributors
Open Energy Transition welcomes contributions also from the wider community. If you are external to Open Energy Transition, you can contribute as detailed below:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Make your changes and commit them.
- Push your changes to your branch.
- Open a pull request to the upstream repository.

### Use the Web IDE for modifying the handbook

It is also possible to modify the handbook by means of the Web IDE.

#### Navigate to the handbook website

Navigate to the [handbook website](https://open-energy-transition.github.io/handbook/) and search for the page you would like to contribute to. In this example, the modifications are applied to the [About the Handbook](docs/Handbook/AboutTheHandbook.mdx) page.

## Add new pages

The handbook uses Docusaurus's documentation functionality as the foundation for its folder and content structure. You can learn more about Docusaurus at [Docusaurus Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

- Every folder must contain an `index.mdx` file. This file will be rendered as the homepage for that section of the handbook.
- Refer to this template for the index page: [Index Template](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/handbook/blob/main/templates/index-template-folder.mdx).
- Although Docusaurus supports both `.md` and `.mdx` file extensions, we recommend using `.mdx` to maintain uniformity across the project.
- Maintainer tags should be present on every page. See all available team members here: [Team](docs/Company/Team.mdx). We use email as a unique identifier.
- All pages must include the following metadata:
```
sidebar_position: 3.7
sidebar_label: "Contribution Guide"
```
- The sidebar position is determined by the parent folder's index page. It should be a single digit for index pages and two digits for other pages in the same directory.
- `sidebar_label` is the name that will appear in the sidebar and other navigation elements. It is best practice to keep it the same as the main heading on the page.
- For best practices, folders should be named using camelCase. For example, the folder for this page should be named `ContributionGuide.mdx`.
- Documents that fall under the controlled category should have the [Controlled Document Banner](ControlledDocument) present.
- For implementing navigation, refer to [Docusaurus Navigation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/links).
- Here is also a link to the template for non-index pages: [Page Template](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/handbook/blob/main/templates/page-template.mdx).
