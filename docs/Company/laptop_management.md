# OET Laptop Management

## Purpose

This document provides an overview of the policies and practices related to the procurement and management of laptops at OET.

## Scope

OET implements centralized management for all company-issued laptops.

## New Hire Laptop Ordering Process

At OET, as a startup, we operate with a lean administrative team. To accommodate our new team members, we provide the following laptop models which are dispatched to the candidate's location:

- [Model1](link)
- [Model2](link)

As we foster a global team, there may be instances where OET is unable to directly order the laptop on your behalf. In such cases, OET will assist you in the procurement process of laptops.

For more details, please refer to the procurement guidelines in the [Candidate Laptop Procurement Section](section-on-page).

## Regular Refresh Cycle

Team members at OET are eligible to refresh their laptops after 3 years of usage. This period is based on the duration of laptop use, not the length of employment. This policy applies even if a used laptop was provided at the time of onboarding. However, if your current laptop meets your needs, you are encouraged to continue using it.

Upon receiving a replacement laptop, you must wipe or return the old one within 2 weeks. Ensure that you transfer all necessary information to the new laptop within this timeframe.

To request a laptop as part of the refresh program, please follow the instructions outlined in the provided template.

Refer to our **[Laptop Buy Back Policy](#laptop-buy-back-policy)** if you're undergoing a laptop refresh.

## Laptops Out of Specification

For laptops that fall outside our standard specifications, approval from a senior is required before we can proceed with the purchase.

## Laptop Replacement Program

Accidents happen, and we understand that. If your laptop is broken or insufficient for your role and you haven't reached the 3-year refresh milestone, you may request a replacement.

To request a replacement for a damaged laptop, create an issue in the End User Services issue tracker, detailing the problem and obtaining your manager's approval within the issue.

## Important Considerations

- Laptops purchased or reimbursed by OET are company property and must be reported to IT Ops with serial numbers, make, model, screen size, and processor details. Use the **[OET Laptop Information Form](#gitlab-laptop-information-form)** for proper asset tracking.
- Loss or damage must be reported immediately.

## Laptop Repair

If your laptop needs repair:

1. Backup your data.
2. Ensure your laptop is not your sole device for two-factor authentication.
3. If the repair costs are below $1000 USD, proceed and expense the repair.
4. Open an issue in the End User Services Issue Tracker to document the repair and get your manager's approval.
5. Do not provide credentials to the repair center. They are authorized to factory reset if necessary.
6. After repair, follow these steps ([instructions here](#reinstall-instructions)) and restore from a backup.

For extensive and costly repairs, where you have no backup laptop, replacing the laptop may be the best option. In such cases, open an issue to replace the laptop following the provided guidelines.

When you receive your new laptop, we will arrange for the old one to be sent to our reseller.

## Configuring New Laptops

New laptops provided by OET need to be configured with security as a primary consideration.

OET team members are required to use an @oet.com email address for creating OET IDs that are separate from any personal IDs. This is to ensure:

1. All backups, keychains, and documents are kept secure and are not mingled with personal data.
2. Multi-factor authentication processes are managed and controlled effectively, reducing the risk of account compromises.
3. A clear boundary is maintained between work and personal accounts to prevent accidental data leaks.
4. Adherence to security best practices at every level of operation. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Security Best Practices](#security-best-practices) documentation.

Proof of whole-disk encryption is mandatory and must be submitted within the new laptop order issue.

## Self-Installation of Operating Systems

In regions where hardware or software availability is constrained, team members may need to self-install Linux on a Dell laptop that was initially configured with OEM Windows. Ensure that you adhere to the required guidelines and open an issue with IT-Ops for confirmation of the installation.

Consider making a complete drive backup before installing Linux to facilitate a smoother return process if needed.

## Laptop Buy Back Policy

Team members who haven't completed 1 year at OET or who have received a laptop refresh within the last year can purchase their laptops at current market value. For those who have used their laptop for over a year, the option to keep the laptop at no charge is available.

All retained laptops must be wiped clean of data.

## Secure Laptop Wipe

Before returning, all laptops must be securely wiped to protect both company and personal information. OET utilizes specific tools to ensure a thorough wipe and to maintain records of the procedure.

Laptops must be wiped through a scheduled appointment with an IT analyst. They will handle the process of wiping the machine, reinstalling the base OS, and removing any software or configurations provided by OET.

Under no circumstances should you attempt to wipe the disk yourself unless directed by IT as part of troubleshooting.

If a device is found to be improperly wiped, OET reserves the right to remotely enforce a wipe without prior notice.
