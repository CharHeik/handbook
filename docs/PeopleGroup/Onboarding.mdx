# Onboarding

<ControlledDocBanner />

Onboarding is incredibly important for us at OET. We highly recommend taking at least a couple of days for onboarding followed by team specific onboarding and training. 
Please feel free to participate in your team’s work in your first week, but don’t feel like you have to contribute heavily. 

For a smooth as possible onboarding we have created a new Onboarding Project for you on the [OET GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/open-energy-transition/projects).

For your first days, on the so-called `Kanban Board` in this project you can find a list of ToDo's that are assigned to you and which you can complete one by one.

## Get started on Day 1

On your first day, you will be welcomed by your Manager in a short Onboarding meeting where they will explain to you some first steps.
You should also have been added to OET's Discord server which is the center to our day-to-day communication. 
For more explanations on the company Discord see below in [Discord Server Support for New Team members](#Discord-Server-Support-for-New-Team-members).
After which, you can start working through your `Kanban Board` in your custom Onboarding Project on the [OET GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/open-energy-transition/projects).
Tasks that you completed, you can mark as resolved. If some tasks don't apply to you, you can also just mark them as resolved.

## First week

During your first week you will continue to work through the issues of your Onboarding Project until they are all completed and the project can be closed.

In your first week, you will be officially introduced to the team in person in the E-Group Weekly that takes place online every Tuesday at 2 p.m. CET.
This is also where you have the chance to get to know everyone in person and say a few words. 
For more information on the E-Group Weekly refer to the [E-Group Weekly](docs/Company/EGroupWeekly.mdx) page in this handbook.

It is very important to us that you always feel supported with any questions that you may have during the inboarding process and your work after. 
To have someone that you can always talk to and share questions and concerns with, you will be assigned a buddy who you will meet in the first week. 
The general idea is that your buddy is also related to the work that you are doing after, so that you two can also discuss specific technical questions.

Within the first day(s), you will also be contacted by your Manager who will slowly introduce you to your projects that you will be involved in. 
You will get some first tasks and reading material to start and familiarize yourself with the projects.

## Discord Server Support for New Team members

OET's Discord Server is the center to our day-to-day communication. 
Here you can find different public channels, text channels as well as project related channels where the OET team regulary exchanges on different topics.
For your first day you will join the Discord and introduce yourself briefly in the `#welcome` channel.
Another important channel for your weekly ToDo's will be the `#discussion`channel. Apart from general discussion, all OET team members have opened their own `prio-talk` threads in this channel.
In their `prio-talk` thread each team member outlines their progress from last week, their current ToDo's and other updates at the beginning of each week. 
Since everyone is working remotely, this helps the team stay connected with regards to what people are up to each week and stimulate helpful exchange on topics.
To create a new thread in a channel you can click on the thread symbol in the top right corner of your discord.

Another useful aspect of the Discord server are the videochat meeting rooms. 
There you can find rooms for co-working, official meetings or even a nice little digital coffee chat with a colleague.

## Managers of New Team members

A new onoarding project is created on the open-energy-transition GitHub for the new team member at least 4 business days prior to their start date. 
In this project a `Kanban Board` is filled with issues that are to be completed by the responsible Manager and HR Team as well as the new member upon onboarding.
Managers, HR and IT Ops all have tasks that need to be completed prior to the start date to ensure a smooth and successful onboarding process. 
For questions or help with any of these tasks feel free to reach out the the responsible HR lead.
