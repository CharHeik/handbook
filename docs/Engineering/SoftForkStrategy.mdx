# Soft fork strategy

<ControlledDocBanner />

## Nomenclature
- OS = open source
- upstream = the main open-source repo for [Pypsa-Eur](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [PyPSA-Earth](https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Problem and context

Open Energy Transition often makes changes to [Pypsa-Eur](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [PyPSA-Earth](https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) that either:
- needs to be merged quickly so that it can be used for ongoing projects,
- are experimental changes that are not ready for the OS upstream, or
- are long-living changes that upstream maintainers do not want in the upstream

In the first two cases cases, the objective is to eventually merge the changes into upstream, so this should be relatively easy to do. So we need Open Energy Transition forks of these repositories to handle these cases, but we also want to keep the forks up-to-date and compatible with upstream.
Will different projects within Open Energy Transition need to use project-specific branches that contain code relevant to just their project? These need to be kept up-to-date and compatible with Open Energy Transition fork’s main branch

## Recommendations

### Fork and branch structure

We propose having forks oet/pypsa-eur and oet/pypsa-earth, with the following structure:
- The fork’s main branch oet/pypsa-x/main is kept up-to-date and compatible with pypsa/pypsa-x/main using the [Soft fork bot](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/soft-fork-bot) regularly.
- Open Energy Transition developers should create branches from oet/pypsa-x/main for new features, and open a pull request to merge them into oet/pypsa-x/main when complete (see below).
    - **Rationale**: Open Energy Transition reviews will be faster than upstream; team-mates can use the new features immediately; our code benefits from extra tests/CI that we have on OET’s fork
    - **Alternative**: if the feature is very small / not urgent / will definitely be merged into upstream quickly, then create a branch from pypsa/pypsa-x/main and open a pull request upstream
- When merging PRs into oet/pypsa-x/main, use squash merging
    - **Rationale**: Not only does this keep the git history of the main branch linear and clean, this also allows one to easily cherry-pick this contribution and make a PR to upstream
- For a project, we might create a long-living branch oet/pypsa-x/project-y, but we treat this as:
    - Project-specific features are committed/PR-ed into oet/pypsa-x/project-y, but other features are PR-ed into oet/pypsa-x/main as above
    - The project branch oet/pypsa-x/project-y is kept up-to-date and compatible with oet/pypsa-x/main regularly (use same strategy as soft fork bot, see below)
    - After the project, create PRs from the project branch back into oet/pypsa-x/main and pypsa/pypsa-x/main as above, and then delete/archive the project branch

#### Why not have a branch oet/pypsa-x/oet-main for long running features, and keep oet/pypsa-x/main equal to pypsa/pypsa-x/main?

The benefits of having an *alias* branch to pypsa/pypsa-x/main are unclear, and as explained in the next section, we want to use OET features such as unit tests when we develop new features. Thus, it makes more sense to have long-living features live in oet/pypsa-x/main, which is kept compatible with (but not equal to) pypsa/pypsa-x/main.

The soft fork bot anyway creates an *upstream* branch in oet/pypsa-x which it uses to track pypsa/pypsa-x/main. This can be used to branch off-of, if for some reason we want a branch containing only upstream features but not OET features.

As explained below in **Contributing OET changes to upstream**, you can make a branch in your own fork (and not the OET fork) when you want to open a PR to pypsa/pypsa-x/main.

### Long-living features
There are some changes, like adding unit tests, that might not be wanted (in the near future) by OS pypsa-x maintainers. However, these will be very useful for our projects, and to ensure that new OET features are more robust and easier to develop. We propose:
- These features be developed in branches from oet/pypsa-x/main and PR-ed into oet/pypsa-x/main when ready
- We do not want to keep them in a separate long-living branch, e.g. oet/pypsa-x/unittests, because then other OET branches and projects do not benefit from them and every additional long-living branch adds some maintenance overhead


### Contributing OET changes to upstream (via cherry-picking)
Suppose you have successfully merged a PR from branch oet/pypsa-eur/UA_sec_fixes into oet/pypsa-eur/main, creating a squash-merged commit 810c25da5:

- Set up 3 remotes in your local checkout of pypsa-eur as follows. Assume that the checkout was obtained by cloning https://github.com/open-energy-transition/pypsa-eur, and then run the following commands:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur.git
git remote add myfork https://github.com/martacki/pypsa-eur.git
# Your remotes should now look like:
git remote -v
myfork	https://github.com/martacki/pypsa-eur.git (fetch)
myfork	https://github.com/martacki/pypsa-eur.git (push)
origin	https://github.com/open-energy-transition/pypsa-eur.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/open-energy-transition/pypsa-eur.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur.git (push)
```
(If your origin is different, you can modify it with git remote set-url origin https://github.com/open-energy-transition/pypsa-eur.git. Also, you might want to use the SSH URLs instead of the HTTPS URLs for the remotes above.)
- Next, create a new branch for your PR off of upstream/master:
```
git fetch upstream  # Only necessary the first time
git checkout upstream/master
git checkout -b OS_UA_sec_fixes
```
- Next, cherry-pick the squashed commit onto this branch: `git cherry-pick 810c25da5`
- At this point, if there are conflicts, you must resolve them and when done, run
```
git add <path/to/conflicted/file>
git cherry-pick --continue
```
- Next, push this branch to myfork: `git push --set-upstream myfork OS_UA_sec_fixes`
You can now go to the website and open a PR from branch OS_UA_sec_fixes to pypsa/pypsa-eur repository.

Note: It might be that the upstream PR ends up making slightly different changes to pypsa/pypsa-x/main as compared to the equivalent commit in oet/pypsa-x/main. This will lead to merge conflicts when running the soft fork bot. But it should be easy to review them and pick the appropriate version of the changes (most likely, the changes from upstream).


### Maintaining a long-living project branch

The Soft Fork Bot does not yet support keeping one branch up-to-date with another. However, for now, we can keep project branches like oet/pypsa-x/project-y up to date with oet/pypsa-x/main by using the same strategy, manually, at regular intervals:
Merge OET’s main branch into the project branch:
```
git checkout oet/pypsa-x/project-y
git merge oet/pypsa-x/main
```
If there are conflicts, resolve them manually, while keeping in mind that “incoming” refers to changes on OET’s main branch and “HEAD” refers to changes in the project branch. Then: `git commit`
